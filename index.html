    <h2>Frank Sinatra</h2>
    <h3>Killing Me Softly</h3>
    <br>I heard she sang a good song,
    <br>I heard she had a style
    <br>and so I came to see her
    <br>and listen for a while.
    <br>And there she was this young girl,
    <br>a stranger to my eyes.
    <br>Strumming my pain with her fingers,
    <br>Singing my life with her words,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song,
    <br>Telling my whole life with her words,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song
    <br>I felt all flushed with fever,
    <br>embarrassed by the crowd,
    <br>I felt she found my letters
    <br>and read each one out loud.
    <br>I prayed that she would finish
    <br>but she just kept right on.
    <br>Strumming my pain with her fingers,
    <br>Singing my life with her words,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song,
    <br>Telling my whole life with her words,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song
    <br>She sang as if she knew me
    <br>in all my dark despair
    <br>And then she looked right through me
    <br>as if I wasn't there.
    <br>But she was there, the stranger,
    <br>singing clear and strong.
    <br>Strumming my pain with her fingers,
    <br>Singing my life with her words,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song,
    <br>Telling my whole life with her words,
    <br>Killing me softly with her song
