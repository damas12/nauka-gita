    <h2>Killing Me Softly</h2>
    <h4>by Frank Sinatra</h4>
    <div class="content">
        <br>I heard she sang a good song,
        <br>I heard she had a style
        <br>and so I came to see her
        <br>and listen for a while.
        <br>And there she was this young girl,
        <br>a stranger to my eyes.
        <br>Strumming my pain with her fingers,
        <br>Singing my life with her words,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song,
        <br>Telling my whole life with her words,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song
        <br>I felt all flushed with fever,
        <br>embarrassed by the crowd,
        <br>I felt she found my letters
        <br>and read each one out loud.
        <br>I prayed that she would finish
        <br>but she just kept right on.
        <br>Strumming my pain with her fingers,
        <br>Singing my life with her words,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song,
        <br>Telling my whole life with her words,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song
        <br>She sang as if she knew me
        <br>in all my dark despair
        <br>And then she looked right through me
        <br>as if I wasn't there.
        <br>But she was there, the stranger,
        <br>singing clear and strong.
        <br>Strumming my pain with her fingers,
        <br>Singing my life with her words,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song,
        <br>Telling my whole life with her words,
        <br>Killing me softly with her song
